- **T1110** - Brute Force (Credential Access)
  - Adversaries may use brute force techniques to guess credentials.
- **T1110** - Brute Force (Credential Access)
  - Successful credential compromise following brute force attempts.

### Recommended Actions
1. ⚠️ PRIORITY: Credential compromise confirmed - immediate containment required
2. 🔐 Check account lockout and MFA status for impacted user
3. 🔍 Review authentication logs for the same source IP across other users
4. 🚫 Consider blocking or rate-limiting the suspicious source IP at the edge
5. 📧 Notify the affected user and verify recent login activity
